# 8-Week-SQL-Challenge

The 8 Week SQL Challenge is proudly brought to you by the Data With Danny virtual data apprenticeship program to celebrate the launch of the Serious SQL course!

## What is the 8 Week SQL Challenge?

My idea was to create a online community which supports all data professionals who were specifically starting on their SQL learning journey.

I also wanted to help everyone start crafting their own personal branding, online presence and a personal portfolio of data projects - and so the 8 Week SQL Challenge was born!

For the next 8 weeks - I challenge you to:

- Dedicate yourself to learning SQL
- Share regular updates on social media about what you are learning
- Get started on your own GitHub Pages personal website and project portfolio

## How can I get started with the challenge?

Share an update on LinkedIn using the dedicated #8WeekSQLChallenge hashtag
Start solving the 8 Week SQL Challenge case studies
Here’s an example post you could share on LinkedIn - please feel free to improvise and personalise your post as much as you like!

## When does the 8 Week SQL Challenge actually start?

In all honesty, the challenge has no official start or end date!

You can literally start and finish the 8 Week SQL Challenge anytime you like - even the 8 week period is not a mandatory requirement :)

I’m ready to start the challenge - what should I learn first?

## What is Serious SQL?

Serious SQL is an online course that I’ve created - it is the very first part of the Data With Danny virtual apprenticeship program.
